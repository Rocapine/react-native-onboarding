here.

## [1.2.0]

### Added

- **ComposableScreen renderer** _(under development)_ — renders the new
  `ComposableScreen` step type by recursively walking a `UIElement` tree and
  mapping each node to a native `View` or `Text`. The renderer now passes
  through all new layout props added in this release: `borderWidth`,
  `borderRadius`, `borderColor`, `overflow`, `opacity`, `margin`,
  `marginHorizontal`, `marginVertical`, `width`, `height`, `minWidth`,
  `maxWidth`, `minHeight`, `maxHeight` on stack elements; `margin`,
  `marginHorizontal`, `marginVertical`, `borderWidth`, `borderRadius`,
  `borderColor`, and `opacity` on text elements.
- `packages/onboarding-ui/README.md` — new README documenting the UI package,
  the `ComposableScreen` element tree API, and its supported props.

> **Note:** `ComposableScreen` is under active development. The renderer and
> element schema may change before they are considered stable.
