# Customization Overview

The SDK provides three levels of customization, from simple theme changes to complete screen replacement. Choose the level that matches your needs.

## The Three Levels

### Level 1: Theming 🎨
**Customize colors, typography, and semantic text styles**

- Easiest to implement
- Works across all screens automatically
- No custom components needed
- Deep merge with default tokens

**Best for:**
- Brand color matching
- Custom fonts
- Typography adjustments
- Semantic style overrides

```typescript
<OnboardingProvider
  theme={{
    colors: { primary: "#FF5733" },
    typography: {
      fontFamily: { title: "MyCustomFont-Bold" }
    }
  }}
/>
```

### Level 2: Custom Components 🔧
**Replace specific UI components with your own**

- Moderate complexity
- Full control over specific components
- Compose with default components
- Support for animations and custom behavior

**Best for:**
- Custom button styles
- Animated lists
- Adding analytics tracking
- Unique interaction patterns

```typescript
<OnboardingProvider
  customComponents={{
    QuestionAnswerButton: MyCustomButton,
    QuestionAnswersList: MyAnimatedList,
  }}
/>
```

### Level 3: Custom Renderers 🎭
**Complete control over entire screens**

- Most complex
- Full control over screen logic and layout
- Custom state management
- Integration with external libraries

**Best for:**
- Completely custom screen designs
- Complex interactions
- External library integration
- Special business logic requirements

```typescript
// In your routing file
export default function OnboardingScreen() {
  const { step } = useOnboardingQuestions({ stepNumber: 1 });

  if (step.type === "Question" && step.id === "custom-question") {
    return <MyCompletelyCustomScreen step={step} />;
  }

  return <OnboardingPage step={step} onContinue={handleContinue} />;
}
```

## Comparison Matrix

| Feature | Level 1: Theming | Level 2: Components | Level 3: Renderers |
|---------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Complexity** | ⭐ Easy | ⭐⭐ Moderate | ⭐⭐⭐ Advanced |
| **Setup Time** | < 5 min | 15-30 min | 1-2 hours |
| **Code Changes** | Provider props | Component creation | Full screen logic |
| **Scope** | All screens | Specific components | Individual screens |
| **Theme Integration** | ✅ Automatic | ✅ Via props | ⚠️ Manual |
| **Update Impact** | ✅ Low | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ High |
| **Flexibility** | Limited | High | Complete |

## Combining Levels

You can combine multiple customization levels:

```typescript
<OnboardingProvider
  // Level 1: Theme tokens
  theme={{
    colors: { primary: "#007AFF" },
    typography: { fontFamily: { title: "CustomFont" } }
  }}
  // Level 2: Custom components
  customComponents={{
    QuestionAnswerButton: AnimatedButton,
  }}
>
  <YourApp />
</OnboardingProvider>

// Level 3: Custom renderer in routing
export default function OnboardingScreen() {
  const { step } = useOnboardingQuestions({ stepNumber });

  // Override specific screen
  if (step.id === "special-screen") {
    return <MyCustomRenderer step={step} />;
  }

  // Use SDK rendering with theme + custom components
  return <OnboardingPage step={step} onContinue={handleContinue} />;
}
```

## Decision Guide

### Choose Level 1 (Theming) if:
- ✅ You want to match brand colors
- ✅ You need custom fonts
- ✅ Default component styles work for you
- ✅ You want minimal maintenance

### Choose Level 2 (Custom Components) if:
- ✅ You need custom animations
- ✅ You want to wrap components for analytics
- ✅ Default layouts work, but specific elements need changes
- ✅ You want to reuse the SDK's state management

### Choose Level 3 (Custom Renderers) if:
- ✅ You need completely custom screen layouts
- ✅ You're integrating third-party libraries
- ✅ You have complex business logic requirements
- ✅ Default renderers don't meet your needs

## Next Steps

Start with the customization level that matches your needs:

1. 🎨 [**Theming**](./theming.mdx) - Colors, typography, and semantic styles
2. 🔧 [**Custom Components**](./custom-components.mdx) - Replace specific UI components
3. 🎭 [**Custom Renderers**](./custom-renderers.mdx) - Complete screen control

:::tip Start Simple
We recommend starting with Level 1 (Theming) and only moving to higher levels when needed. Most customization needs can be met with theming alone.
